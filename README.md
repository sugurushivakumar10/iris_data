# iris_data
Letâ€™s implement k-means clustering using a famous dataset
the Iris dataset. This dataset contains 3 classes of 50 instances each and each class refers to a type of iris plant. 
The dataset has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 
The fifth column is for species, which holds the value for these types of plants. For example, one of the types is a setosa, as shown in the image below.
